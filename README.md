   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   Or alternatively:

### Production Deployment on PythonAnywhere

1. **Upload files** to your PythonAnywhere account

2. **Install Flask** in your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pip3.10 install flask
   ```

3. **Configure WSGI file** (`/var/www/yourusername_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py`):
   ```python
   import sys
   import os

   # Add your project directory to sys.path
   project_home = '/home/yourusername/mindmashup'
   if project_home not in sys.path:
